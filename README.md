# Report Topic Classification

This repository contains the code to generate keywords for topics based on Wikipeida articles and then find the keywords in text data. This code is used to assess sustainability reports for the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.opendata.ch/en/) project businessresponsibility.ch For more information visit https://github.com/bizres or https://www.businessresponsibility.ch/

# If you are interested in the project...

... go to our [main repository](https://github.com/bizres) to read up on our project.

# If you are interested in the code...

... look at our [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bizres/report-topic-classification/blob/master/usage_example.ipynb) to see how we use Wikipeida articles to generate topic keywords and detect topics in sustainability reports.

# If you are interested in the development...

- For development we use Ubuntu 20.04 with Python ^3.9. But the code should also run on Windows with Python ^3.9
- If necessary, install Python 3.9 and Pipenv and spawn a virtual environment with ```pipenv shell```
- Install libraries using the Pipfile with ```pipenv install```
- Have fun developing ;-)
